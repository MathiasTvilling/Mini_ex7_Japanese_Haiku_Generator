Try out the program! OBS: The text shows up after a few seconds, be patient https://rawgit.com/MathiasTvilling/Mini_ex7_Japanese_Haiku_Generator/master/Japanese_Haiku_Generator/empty-example/index.html

Description of program: 
This programs intended use was to generate Haiku. We found a lot of famous haiku poems, and made the program generate each line, so an unique poem is created every time. This was done by using arrays, one holding each "first liners", one holding the second lines, and a last holding the third lines. On top of that we included a background picture of mount Fuji, while ‘’sterotypical’’ Japanese music is playing. We implemented a new font, to give the text a more personal touch. 

We wanted to implement sound which would read the poem which was generated, but after an incredible time trying to do this, we finally gave up. We have left the code in the program, if the reader of this ReadME wants to see where it went wrong. Evryone is wwelcome to have a go at solving the problem. All sound files are available in the "quotes" folder. 

Unlike the example of Winnies code in class, which could be read as a poem when reading the code out loud, this program is much more one dimensional. This is to be understood in the sense, that the progrtam generates something "poetic", something readable - but the code in it self does not have much to say. It is written purly with effectiveness and purpose, not in order to be read as a poem. In this sense, the language of the code can be seen more in the sense of something executable, instead of something which can be performed. It does not have the speechlike qualities, which are discussed in the text. This means that the code in itself is not an expression as much as it is a tool.
